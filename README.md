# This is the mobile app Impakt, meant for onboarding and mobilizing people into grassroots movements. 

It's built in React Native, with Expo enabled. You can find out about our goals at https://impakt.network

## 1. The overview

Impakt is an app framework that aims to be a one-stop shop for any grassroots cause. It will help your supporters find each other, organize, convince their friends to get involved and stay safe from overreach and violence.

Here are some features already present in this version:

- Toolkit for efficiently reaching out to your friends about issues that are important to them.
- Easily contacting the nearest "coordinator" of the movement
- Local events calendar
- Domain fronting. However, this is only acheved by using a large hosting service. This should be overhauled in the future.
- Pseudonymous local chat

The app logs nothing but your choice of region you're in. We believe that social movements are most powerful when ephemeral.
## 2. How to run it.

Use Expo to code and run it in real time, and to compile an apk.

You can also use an already compiled apk: https://mega.nz/file/smIxGayR#mtv4Juk_YsRsj2ZxHMWjoIw6iR8xCs69fCqhCZiaakk
